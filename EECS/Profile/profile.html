        <p>Saitama (サイタマ) is the most powerful being that exists. Saitama faces a self-imposed existential crisis, as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his good deeds.

            Initially just a hero for fun, he later registers into the Hero Association as a professional hero, currently B-Class Rank 7, and defends his home in Z-City from Mysterious Beings. Under the Hero Association, he is given the name Caped Baldy (ハゲマント).</p>
